2. Set up monitoring:
   - Add Google Analytics measurement ID
   - Configure error tracking service (e.g., Sentry)

3. Verify deployment:
   - Test installation on various devices
   - Validate offline functionality
   - Check performance metrics
   - Confirm all security headers are applied

4. Monitor and maintain:
   - Regular bundle size checks
   - Performance audits
   - Security updates
   - Dependency updates
